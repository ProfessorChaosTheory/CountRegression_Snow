# Predicting Snow Days in Fitchburg, MA: A Count Regression Approach

## Overview
This project uses Poisson regression to predict the number of school-closing snow days for the remainder of winter (December 22 - April 30) in Fitchburg, Massachusetts, using only meteorological and climatological information available through December 21st.

## Project Goal
Develop a seasonal forecasting model that enables schools, municipalities, and emergency services to anticipate winter severity and allocate resources effectively, using pre-winter and early-winter indicators.

## Dataset
- **Source**: Daily weather data for Fitchburg, MA (1950-2024) + Climate teleconnection indices from NOAA
- **Time Period**: 74 winter seasons (1951-2024)

## Snow Day Definition
A day qualifies as a "snow day" if it meets either criterion:
- 4+ inches of snowfall, OR
- Apparent temperature minimum below -10°F

These thresholds approximate school-closing conditions in the region.

## Key Variables

**Response Variable:**
- `snow_days_count`: Number of snow days from December 22 through April 30

**Predictor Variables (all measured through December 21):**

*Pre-Season Conditions (May 1 - December 21):*
- Total rainfall and snowfall
- Average temperature and temperature range
- Total precipitation

*November Metrics:*
- Average temperature and total snowfall
- Temperature trend (early vs. late month)

*December Metrics (through Dec 21):*
- Average temperature and total snowfall
- Days with measurable snow
- Temperature trend

*Climate Teleconnection Indices (October-December):*
- **ONI** (Oceanic Niño Index): El Niño/La Niña indicator
- **NAO** (North Atlantic Oscillation): Controls East Coast storm tracks
- **AO** (Arctic Oscillation): Influences cold air outbreaks
- **PNA** (Pacific/North American Pattern): Affects temperature patterns

## Methodology
- **Model Type**: Poisson Regression (count data with Poisson-distributed events)
- **Feature Selection**: Based on correlation analysis and meteorological theory
- **Model Evaluation**: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Pseudo R²

## Model Performance
- **MAE**: [1.21] snow days
- **RMSE**: [1.54] snow days
- **Pseudo R²**: ~0.17
- Result is reasonable given the inherent unpredictability of winter weather 3-4 months in advance

## Key Findings
- December snowfall patterns provide strongest signal for remainder of winter
- Arctic Oscillation (AO) shows significant negative correlation with snow days
- November temperature trends contribute meaningful predictive value
- Pre-season snowfall shows modest but consistent relationship
- Model performance aligns with operational seasonal forecasting capabilities

## Scientific Context
This work builds on established research showing:
- Nor'easter snowstorms follow Poisson distribution (Karvetski et al., 2009)
- NAO/AO strongly influence Northeast winter weather (Leathers et al., 1991)
- Arctic amplification affects mid-latitude winter patterns (Cohen et al., 2020)

## Technologies Used
- **R** (4.4.0)
- **tidyverse** - Data manipulation and visualization
- **tidymodels** - Model building and evaluation
- **MASS** - Negative binomial regression capabilities

## Climate Data Sources
- ONI, NAO, AO, PNA indices from NOAA Climate Prediction Center
- Historical weather data from Open-Meteo API

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Install required packages: `install.packages(c("tidyverse", "tidymodels", "MASS", "lubridate"))`
3. Use provided `climate_data.csv`)
4. Run `Project3_analysis.R` to process weather data
5. Open and render `Project3_report.qmd` for complete analysis

## Future Improvements
- Incorporate additional climate indices (MJO, EPO)
- Explore ensemble modeling approaches
- Add spatial analysis for regional variations
- Develop operational forecasting dashboard
